# Resource `jumpcloud_system_group`

This resource allows you to create and manage JumpCloud System Groups. System Groups are sets of systems that can be managed collectively within JumpCloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_system_group" "example" {
  name      = "example"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `name` (String) The name of the system group. If omitted, JumpCloud will attempt to create a group with an empty name (which may or may not be allowed in your JumpCloud instance).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Terraform resource ID, which is set to the system group’s name in JumpCloud.
- `jc_id` (String) The internal JumpCloud ID of the system group.

## Import
This resource can be imported by specifying the name of the system group (because the Terraform resource ID is tied to the group’s name in JumpCloud):
```
terraform import jumpcloud_system_group.example "existing_group_name"
```
