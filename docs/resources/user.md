# Resource `jumpcloud_user`

Provides a JumpCloud system user resource. For additional information refer also to the [JumpCloud API user model](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/models/systemuserpost).

## Example Usage

### Basic User

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_user" "john_doe" {
  username      = "john.doe"
  email         = "john.doe@acme.org"
  firstname     = "John"
  lastname      = "Doe"
  display_name  = "John Doe"
  enable_mfa    = true
}

output "userid" {
  value = jumpcloud_user.john_doe.id
}
```

### User with Group Memberships

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_user_group" "developers" {
  name = "Developers"
}

resource "jumpcloud_user_group" "admins" {
  name = "Admins"
}

resource "jumpcloud_user" "john_doe" {
  username      = "john.doe"
  email         = "john.doe@acme.org"
  firstname     = "John"
  lastname      = "Doe"
  display_name  = "John Doe"
  enable_mfa    = true

  # Manage group memberships directly on the user resource
  groups = [
    jumpcloud_user_group.developers.id,
    jumpcloud_user_group.admins.id,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) The users e-mail address, which is also used for log ins. E-mail addresses have to be unique across all JumpCloud accounts, there cannot be two users with the same e-mail address. Example: `john.doe@acme.org`.
- `username` (String) The technical user name. See JumpCloud's [user naming conventions](https://support.jumpcloud.com/support/s/article/naming-convention-for-users1) for naming restrictions. Example: `john.doe`.

### Optional

- `display_name` (String) The user's display name. Example: `john doe`.
- `enable_mfa` (Boolean) Require Multi-factor Authentication on the User Portal.
- `firstname` (String) The user's first name. Example: `john`.
- `groups` (Set of String) Set of group IDs this user belongs to. The user will be added to all specified groups and removed from any groups not in this list. This provides a user-centric approach to managing group memberships. **Note:** Do not use this field in combination with `jumpcloud_user_group_membership` resources for the same user, as it may cause conflicts.
- `lastname` (String) The user's last name. Example: `doe`.
- `ldap_binding_user` (Boolean)
- `password` (String)
- `password_never_expires` (Boolean)
- `passwordless_sudo` (Boolean)
- `phone_number` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--phone_number))
- `sudo` (Boolean)
- `suspended` (Boolean)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--phone_number"></a>
### Nested Schema for `phone_number`

Required:

- `number` (String)
- `type` (String)

## Managing Group Memberships

There are three ways to manage user group memberships in JumpCloud:

### 1. User-Centric Approach (Recommended for Individual Users)

Use the `groups` field on the `jumpcloud_user` resource to manage all group memberships for a user in one place:

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_user" "alice" {
  username = "alice"
  email    = "alice@example.com"
  groups   = [
    jumpcloud_user_group.developers.id,
    jumpcloud_user_group.admins.id,
  ]
}
```

**Pros:** Simple, all user information in one place, atomic operations
**Cons:** Less modular, harder to reuse in modules

### 2. Group-Centric Approach

Use the `members` field on the `jumpcloud_user_group` resource to manage all users in a group:

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_user_group" "developers" {
  name    = "Developers"
  members = [
    jumpcloud_user.alice.email,
    jumpcloud_user.bob.email,
  ]
}
```

**Pros:** Manage group composition in one place
**Cons:** Uses emails instead of IDs, group-centric view only

### 3. Explicit Membership Resources

Use individual `jumpcloud_user_group_membership` resources for each user-group association:

```terraform
resource "jumpcloud_user_group_membership" "alice_to_devs" {
  userid  = jumpcloud_user.alice.id
  groupid = jumpcloud_user_group.developers.id
}
```

**Pros:** Very granular, modular, reusable
**Cons:** Many resources for users with multiple groups

### Important: Avoid Conflicts

**Do not use multiple approaches for the same user**, as they may conflict with each other. For example, don't use both the `groups` field on a user and `jumpcloud_user_group_membership` resources for the same user.
